- Charlie Fadness:  I am a massage therapist for over 9 years now, from my love of baking, I learned that I tend to be very specific and have a logical mindset. From there, after discussing coding with friends and learning python, I knew where my path would go. From my expierence at Code Fellows, I found I love helping and teaching as this makes me have to keep thinking of the subjects from a different mindset as I always try to explain things from a different aspect to keep learning new things everyday!

## Project Description

We live in the wealthiest, most technoligically advanced time in the history of mankind. Disease, poverty, malnutrition, pestulance are systemically being erradicated.
And yet, with all this abundance there is an epidemic of depression, isolation, suicide, and lonliness.
Our app: Source of Peace is designed to introduce users to the ancient wisdom of the Tao Te Ching. Each day the user can choose to read a chapter of the Tao Te Ching, and then there is a place to capture one's thoughts.

## Problem Domain & our Solution

Life is so busy and full of distractions. Many people are searching for ways to relieve stress, connect with a sense of purpose and meaning--but it must be able to nest within time constraints most people operate under.
Our thought is the 'minimum effective dose' of any time of reading reflection is about 10 minutes. Our app gives the user a choice for the amount of time to meditate/breathe/center themselves.
After a moment to center oneself, the user is transported to another page that shows a short Tao reading, with the opportunity to record one's thoughts/reflections.
