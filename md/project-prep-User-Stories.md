## TITLE: Developer's wishes
As a developer, I want to be able to bring a chance for a person to visit the app, come feel stressed, and be able to focus on themselves. I want the user to be able to calm their breathing, be able to destress, know that this is a safe place, and to evaluate our quotes. We want to help the user by having them respond in a way that they can see what is happening from either a different perspective, or even understand more about what is going on and how to deal with that stress. After they will read the quote, they can then decide if they want to log down their thoughts on to reference or get it off their chest.

- Be able to find a safe place
- Animation to help with breathing, focusing on big, slow breaths

## TITLE: Breadcrumb Instructions
As a user, I want the intial interaction with the app to be super obvious. If I am asked to breathe--how, exactly do I breath?

### Feature Task:
- Super clear instructions on what the first breathing exercise is
- Prompt or H1 tag that explains exactly how to breath. For exmpale: For the next minute(s) you will exercise a 'centering breathing exercise'. Once the timer starts, close your eyes (or watch gif), and breathe in through your nose for a count of 4, hold for a count of 4, exhale for a count of 4, and rest for a count of 4. You will do 4 rounds of this breathing
