# Software Requirements

## What is the vision of this product?

The vision of this product is to be able to bring peace of mind to people through our app in ways of colors, descriptions, user diary, while being able to destress, relax, and be a peaceful place the whole time.

## What pain point does this project solve?

Our software is nessessary becomes it brings the user to a spot that they may not have access to all the time. Sometimes we are put into a position where we do not know where to go and loose sight out the things that matter. Being able to open something, and knowing that you are able to get more insite, be able to calm down and relax, read a quote to stretch/strenghen your mind, and be able to log down your thinking to reference it again will be a powerful tool that will help any user.

## Why whould we care about your product?

You should care for our project for a few reasons. One being a stress relief. We want users to know when they need a moment to themselves or even to catch their break. That they can open our app, read small sentences, follow a few directions, and know they will slowly be able to snap out of whatever may be holding them back or finally release their stress by logging it.

From when the user first enters the site, they will be prompted with the name, then have a relaxation technique to do for around a minute, once the time has ended, they will have a chance to view one or multiple quotes. Then be able to log their thoughts down and save them for later to reference or look back on.

Anytime during the app, the user can also click on the about us page, that will show the user who designed the app. They will be able to go back to the home page through a navigation drop down or clicking on the logo.
