          <p>
            I'm a 30 year old from Brisbane Australia that started plumbing at the age of 16,<br>
            Due to a workplace accident I suffered a life changing injury,<br>
            This unfortunate event has opened up a new opportunity for me to learn a new skill set,<br>
            My coding journey has already showed me many areas where my learned and natural ability's will lead me to
            find a great level of success and make me an invaluable member of any future team I become a member of.

          <p>
            I am a massage therapist for over 9 years now, from my love of baking, I learned that I liked very specific
            things. From there I talked to some friends, tried out some coding, and the rest is history! From my
            experience at Code Fellows, I love helping and teaching as this makes me have to keep thinking of the
            subjects from a different mindset I always try to explain things from a different aspect to keep learning
            new things everyday!
