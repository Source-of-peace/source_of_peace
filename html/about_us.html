          <p>
            I'm a 30 year old from Brisbane Australia that started plumbing at the age of 16,<br>
            Due to a workplace accident I suffered a life changing injury,<br>
            This unfortunate event has opened up a new opportunity for me to learn a new skill set,<br>
            My coding journey has already showed me many areas where my learned and natural ability's will lead me to find a great level of success and make me an invaluable member of any future team I become a member of.

          <h3>Charlie Fadness:</h3>
          <h4>Project Roll:</h4>
          <p>
            Project: My main roll in this project was bringing all the ideas to paper. I always want to be able to see what the project might look like near the end, and be able to see how I am able to actually refer that into the code itself even if its only peudo code. I love the programming side and having to keep thinking and develop our skills to move forward to reach new heights!
          </p>
          <h4>About Me:</h4>
          <p>
            My name is Charlie Fadness. I am a massage therapist for over 9 years now, from my love of baking, I learned that I liked very specific things. From there I talked to some friends, tried out some coding, and the rest is history! From my expierence at Code Fellows, I love helping and teaching as this makes me have to keep thinking of the subjects from a different mindset I always try to explain things from a different aspect to keep learning new things everyday!
